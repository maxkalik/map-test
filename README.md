# Map

## Main Objective

Create an iOS application that connects to a server, loads a list of users and shows their current location on a map in real time.

## Communication with the server

Application should communicate with ios-test.printful.lv:6111 using TCP.

When initially connecting to the server the application should send the following command: "AUTHORIZE email" where "email" is your email address. The server will respond with the list of users in the following format: "USERLIST <id>,<name>,<image>,<latitude>,<longitude>;<id2>,<name2>,<image2>,<lat itude2>,<longitude2>"...

Connection to the server should be left open in order to continuously receive latest user coordinates in the following format: UPDATE "<user id>,<latitude>,<longitude>" All commands should be separated using a newline character (\n).

## Design

The app should look as seen in the example image

* When tapping on user location a bubble shows up displaying the user name, profile image and current address.
* Address has to update in real time, based on user location.
* User location can be represented with any custom image (yellow ball it the example image).
* The user location image has to smoothly animate to the latest coordinates when they are received from the server.
